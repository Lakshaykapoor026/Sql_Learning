                                                                                                        SQL
- Stands for Structured Query Language
-Used  for relational database(RDBMS) and  also used to retrieve and manipulate data
-Way of communicating with database
-Non-procedural language(means you cannot write complete applications with it but can communicate with data)
 
     Types of SQL Languages
       -------------------------
1. DDL(Data Definiton Language):  used to create or alter tables
commands used-  CREATE, ALTER

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language): used to manipulate data
commands used: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE
3. DCL(Data Control Language): Give access to whom and how much
commands used- REVOKE(access lena), GRANT(access dena), DENY(block access)
4. TCL(Transaction Control Language): used to save changed data or to restore data
commands used- COMMIT(to finalise the action), ROLLBACK(used to correct mistake), BEGIN( to start the action)

     TYPES OF KEYS
     ------------------
1.  PRIMARY KEY - uniquely identifies a tuple in db , it cannot be null, a table has only one primary key

Eg. customer ID PRIMARY KEY
       -----------     (underline meaning this is a PK)
2. FOREIGN KEY- makes relation between 2 tables , FK of 1 table points to the PK of another
3. UNIQUE KEY - uniquely defines the tuple but it can be null

HOW to create DB 
-------------------
 syntax- CREATE DATABASE db_name;
Create Table
------------
CREATE TABLE tablename(colname datatype(size), colname2 dtatype(size)........);
eg. CREATE TABLE employee( ID INT(5) PRIMARY KEY ,
                                                    NAME VARCHAR(255),
                                                       SALARY DECIMAL(4,2)
                                                                );
# Manipulating CommandS:
SELECT, WHERE, UPDATE, DELETE,INSERT, TRUNCATE
1. SELECT-
eg. SELECT ID
   from emp
where AGE>14;

#OPERATors-
AND, OR ,IN, NOT IN, LIKE,  IS NOT NULL, BETWEEN AND
-------------
eg. SELECT ID
   from emp
where AGE>14 AND GENDER= 'Female'; 

.... SELECT DOB
   FROM emp
where AGE>=18 OR GENDER='F';

........RAM, SHam, ghansham
firstname IN('.RAM', 'SHam', 'ghansham')
.... LIKE operator- PATTERN MATCHING
firstname LIKE('%SHAY%');

....... BETWEEN AND
 eg. WHERE
hiredate BETWEEN'12-01-2021' AND '12-01-2022';
.....IS NOT NULL- return all enteries which are not null
eg. WHERE
last_name IS NOT NULL;

SELECT DISTINCT-
eg. SELECT DISTINCT NAME
from emp
where age>14;

#AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:

SUM(), MAX(),MIN(),AVG(),COUNT()
EG. SELECT  AVG(SALARY), COUNT(GENDER),
from emp;

#ALIAS - give new name
EG. SELECT  AVG(SALARY) AS SALARY
